# Changelog for v1.1.1-beta

## Added
- Enhanced module system architecture with standardized interfaces
- ComponentInterface for creating pluggable system components
- Runtime component management in VM with registerComponent() method
- Improved build system with new helper functions (add_neutron_module, add_neutron_feature, etc.)
- New modular directory structure (src/features/, src/extensions/, src/utils/)
- Extended documentation in docs/extending_neutron.md

## Changed
- Refactored CMakeLists.txt for better modularity and extensibility
- Organized source files into logical groups for better maintainability
- Enhanced VM with component registry capabilities
- Improved build system to support easier addition of new features

## Fixed
- **Logical operators (AND/OR) with proper short-circuit evaluation**
  - Fixed `and` operator to properly evaluate `a and b` as: if `a` is falsy return `a`, else return `b`
  - Fixed `or` operator to properly evaluate `a or b` as: if `a` is truthy return `a`, else return `b`
  - Implemented correct short-circuit evaluation to avoid unnecessary operand evaluation
  - Resolved stack underflow issues with complex logical expressions
  - Fixed handling of negative numbers and complex conditions in logical expressions

- Build system now properly handles modular component addition
- Better separation of concerns in the codebase
- Resolved linking issues with module initialization functions
